When an admin creates a new NCC edition in your app (e.g. NCC 2025, NCC 2028), the questions should not be generic metadata. They should exist to answer one core system problem:

“How does this NCC edition differ from previous ones in a way that affects compliance logic, data ingestion, and existing projects?”

Below is a clean, future-proof question set, grouped by purpose. This is written so you can directly convert it into an admin UI wizard and backend schema.

⸻

1. Edition Identity & Authority (non-negotiable)

These define what the edition is and who governs it.
	1.	What is the official NCC edition name?
(e.g. NCC 2025, NCC 2028)
	2.	What is the legal commencement date?
(Important for transitional rules)
	3.	What is the edition status?
	•	Draft
	•	Adopted
	•	Superseded
	•	Withdrawn
	4.	Which authority published this edition?
(Usually Australian Building Codes Board)
	5.	Does this edition replace a previous edition or coexist during a transition period?

⸻

2. Structural Scope (drives data loading & routing)

These questions control which rulesets get loaded and where they apply.
	6.	Which NCC volumes are included in this edition?
	•	Volume One
	•	Volume Two
	•	Volume Three
	•	Housing Provisions
	7.	Have any volumes been structurally reorganised?
(Clause renumbering, merged sections, split parts)
	8.	Are any building classes newly introduced, removed, or redefined?
	9.	Are Performance Requirements restructured or reworded in this edition?
(Yes → impacts Rules-as-Code mapping)

⸻

3. Machine-Readable Data & Ingestion (critical for automation)

These questions decide whether your app can automate or must fallback to manual logic.
	10.	Is official XML data available for this NCC edition?
	11.	Is the XML schema backward-compatible with the previous edition?

	•	Fully compatible
	•	Partially compatible
	•	Breaking changes

	12.	Does this edition introduce new data fields or metadata tags?
(e.g. new attributes for climate zones, materials, fire ratings)
	13.	Does this edition deprecate or remove existing XML nodes?
	14.	Is the XML released under the same licence (CC BY 4.0)?
(If not → legal flag)

⸻

4. Regulatory Logic Changes (Rules-as-Code impact)

These questions determine what breaks, what must be re-validated, and what can be reused.
	15.	Which DTS provisions have changed thresholds or numeric limits?
(e.g. glazing values, FRLs, stair dimensions)
	16.	Are there entirely new DTS pathways introduced?
	17.	Have any DTS provisions been removed or invalidated?
	18.	Do any Performance Requirements now require mandatory verification methods?
	19.	Does this edition introduce new mandatory documentation or evidence types?

⸻

5. Referenced Standards Impact (copyright-safe handling)

These questions prevent you from accidentally breaking copyright law.
	20.	Have any referenced Australian Standards been added, removed, or updated?
	21.	Are updated standards mandatory or optional during transition?
	22.	Do any referenced standards now replace prescriptive NCC text?
	23.	Does this edition increase reliance on external standards for compliance decisions?

(This informs whether you show “reference only” links vs calculators)

⸻

6. State & Territory Variations (jurisdiction engine)

These questions drive your variation override system.
	24.	Which States/Territories have variations in this edition?
	25.	Are variations published as machine-readable datasets?
	26.	Do any variations override national DTS provisions?
	27.	Do any variations introduce stricter or additional requirements?
	28.	Are transitional rules different per state?

⸻

7. Transition & Project Compatibility (protects existing users)

These are essential to avoid breaking active projects.
	29.	Can existing projects remain locked to earlier NCC editions?
	30.	Is automatic migration allowed or forbidden for this edition?
	31.	Does this edition require re-assessment of in-progress approvals?
	32.	Is there a cutoff date after which older editions are invalid?
	33.	Should users be warned when mixing editions across projects?

⸻

8. App Behaviour & UX Controls (what users actually feel)

These questions define how the app behaves once the edition is live.
	34.	Should this edition be selectable by default for new projects?
	35.	Should older editions be hidden, archived, or still selectable?
	36.	Should the AI assistant be allowed to answer questions using this edition immediately, or only after validation?
	37.	Does this edition require new calculators, checklists, or workflows?
	38.	Should this edition trigger system-wide reindexing (search, AI, rules engine)?

⸻

9. Legal & Risk Flags (silent but critical)

These protect you as the platform owner.
	39.	Does this edition introduce higher liability risk areas?
(Fire safety, waterproofing, structural changes)
	40.	Does this edition require updated disclaimers or legal text in the app?
	41.	Is this edition marked as “guidance only” during early adoption?
	42.	Has this edition been reviewed and signed off internally before activation?

⸻

10. Internal Version Control (admin-only, future proofing)

These make your system scale beyond NCC.
	43.	What internal version ID should this edition use?
(e.g. ncc_2025_v1)
	44.	Is this edition allowed to receive hotfixes or amendments?
	45.	Should amendments be treated as patches or new editions?
	46.	Should audit logs track which edition answered each user query?

⸻

🔑 The Golden Rule (important)

Users should never “create” an NCC edition.
Admins do.
Users only select an edition.

Your admin flow is not a form — it’s a controlled release pipeline.

⸻

If you want, next I can:
	•	Turn this into a single admin wizard flow
	•	Design the Supabase schema for NCC editions
	•	Write a Cursor-ready spec explaining how the backend should treat editions
	•	Or define what must be hard-blocked vs soft-warned when editions change

Just tell me which one you want next.
