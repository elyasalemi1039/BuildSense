There are certain conventions and approaches that need to be taken into account when using the NCC. This includes interpreting specific language and terms. This is critical to understanding the intended technical and legal meaning of the NCC. This Part also explains the difference between the mandatory Parts of the NCC and the Parts that are only explanatory or guidance in nature.</p></intro-part><subtopic id="_09f53286-d410-4d60-9034-c7595dee0f77" subtopic-type="governance"><clauseref id="_b892df65-081a-4510-a493-01606e89662e" outputclass="clausref-ncc"><clause conref="/tmp/QppServer/Publishing/5e2c1f63-e589-4ce1-95e8-5c3e286a7aff/4885_0.7.0.xml" id="_d5df8293-6dd2-4b03-ad7d-dfd446a4ef7b" outputclass="ncc-clause"><sptc/><title id="_f621e28e-6ff2-4a63-a5e1-2d38bdf2937a"/><archive-num/></clause></clauseref><clauseref id="_9b336bea-0150-4ee6-aa05-6e613c169696" outputclass="clausref-ncc"><clause conref="/tmp/QppServer/Publishing/5e2c1f63-e589-4ce1-95e8-5c3e286a7aff/4886_0.4.0.xml" id="_31aedd23-c5d3-428c-ab49-77774319d972" outputclass="ncc-clause"><sptc/><title id="_3eee9121-076d-430c-8f11-0a9ce24f4c7b"/><archive-num/></clause></clauseref><clauseref id="_a76870d3-aeb5-42c0-b153-8d2eb9fd3a3c" outputclass="clausref-ncc"><clause conref="/tmp/QppServer/Publishing/5e2c1f63-e589-4ce1-95e8-5c3e286a7aff/4887_0.7.0.xml" id="_92e960fd-431e-438a-8719-025ad168976d" outputclass="ncc-clause"><sptc/><title id="_a6b0a58f-b3dc-4b49-9f51-21af37404d6d"/><archive-num/></clause></clauseref><clauseref id="_978eaa0e-02e9-4987-88a1-74ede9dcc1ab" outputclass="clausref-ncc"><clause conref="/tmp/QppServer/Publishing/5e2c1f63-e589-4ce1-95e8-5c3e286a7aff/1482_1.6.0.xml" id="_b6875014-f2cb-4953-be52-5cb0c9483a26" outputclass="ncc-clause"><sptc/><title id="_db6e19a3-c4d1-495a-8549-865fb0556ae9"/><archive-num/></clause></clauseref></subtopic><callout id="_353a3bea-5154-4113-b7c5-03e4ff4bd841"><callout-type ncc-info-type="info"/><p>Explanatory information and Introduction information contained in the NCC is non-mandatory and is provided for guidance purposes only. This informative material should be read in conjunction with the technical provisions of the NCC. Any statements made in the informative and guidance components of the NCC should not be taken to override the NCC. Unlike the NCC, which is adopted by legislation, the informative and guidance components are not called up into legislation and they do not cover State and Territory variations and additions. Because informative and guidance components of the NCC do not have regulatory force, the ABCB accepts no responsibility for its contents when applied to specific buildings or any liability which may result from its use.</p><p>Defined words provide the precise meaning and expressions of key words used for understanding and complying with the NCC. Where a word is not defined in the NCC, the relevant common meaning of the word should be used.</p><p>Generally, a reference to a building is a reference to the whole building, regardless of classification. However, when a provision is applicable to a specific class or classes of building, that reference to a building may be a reference to the whole building or part of the building depending on how the building is classified.</p><p>Classes 1a and 1b, 7a and 7b, 9a, 9b and 9c, and 10a, 10b and 10c are separate classifications. In the NCC, when the designation 'a', 'b' or 'c' is not applied, the reference is to all buildings of the general class. For example, 'Class 9b' refers only to Class 9b buildings, but 'Class 9' refers to Classes 9a, 9b and 9c.</p><p>Whether a provision applies or not depends on the circumstances of the case and the circumstances in which the reference is made. For example, where a building has a single classification, a reference to a building in the NCC is understandably a reference to a whole building. However, where a building has parts of different classification, unless the contrary intention appears (i.e. there is a specific reference to the whole building), a reference to a building in the NCC is a reference to the relevant part of the building. This means that each part of the building must comply with the relevant provisions for its classification.</p><p>A number of the <xref format="dita" href="/tmp/QppServer/Publishing/5e2c1f63-e589-4ce1-95e8-5c3e286a7aff/1395_4.0.0.xml#_f7304862-3529-49d7-9f62-352bcbcb6294" id="_9bd1d193-658d-4530-8e84-548b2edd6aae" referencetype="Text" scope="local" synctargettext="false" type="abcb-glossentry">Performance Requirements</xref> of the NCC use the expression “to the degree necessary” or “appropriate to”.
