As a performance-based code, it sets the minimum required level for the safety, health, amenity, accessibility and sustainability of certain buildings. It primarily applies to the design and construction of new buildings, and plumbing and drainage systems in new and existing buildings. In some cases it may also apply to structures associated with buildings and new building work or new plumbing and drainage work in existing buildings.</p><p>The Australian Building Codes Board (ABCB), on behalf of the Australian Government and each State and Territory government, produces and maintains the NCC. When determining the content of the NCC, the ABCB seeks to—</p><ul><li>ensure requirements have a rigorously tested rationale; and</li><li>effectively and proportionally address applicable issues; and</li><li>create benefits to society that outweigh costs; and</li><li>consider non-regulatory alternatives; and</li><li>consider the competitive effects of regulation; and</li><li>not be unnecessarily restrictive.</li></ul></section><p>The primary users of the NCC include architects, builders, plumbers, building surveyors, hydraulic consultants, engineers and other building and plumbing related professions and trades.</p><section id="_157b9aca-54d2-4a68-81f4-ae750c9e716d"><title id="_7fc4309f-6127-46cb-b54c-91171b2d798d">Format of the NCC</title><p>The NCC is published in three volumes.

In each clause number—</p><ul><li>The first letter indicates which NCC Section sits within, or if the letter S is used, that the clause is part of a Specification. The letter S is used in place of a Section indicator because the same Specification may be called up in several different Sections of the NCC.</li><li>The first number indicates the number of each Part within a Section, or the number of a Specification. Parts are numbered sequentially within each Section, starting at 1. Specifications are numbered sequentially across all three volumes, also starting at 1.</li><li>The second letter indicates the clause Type. It will be G, O, F, P, V, D or C and these are explained below.</li><li>The second number is the clause number within each Part or Specification.</li></ul></section><p>The clause Types used in the NCC are as follows:</p><ul><li>G = Governing requirement (mandatory)</li><li>O = Objective (guidance)</li><li>F = Functional Statement (guidance)</li><li>P = Performance Requirement (mandatory)</li><li>V = Verification Method (optional)</li><li>D = Deemed-to-Satisfy Provision (optional) </li><li>C = Clause in a Specification (clauses in Specifications may be mandatory or optional, depending on how the Specification is called up by the NCC). </li></ul><p>Informative parts of the NCC (e.g. Introduction to the NCC) are not numbered and do not have numbered paragraphs.

Any statements made in the informative and guidance components of the NCC should not be taken to override the NCC. Unlike the NCC, which is adopted by legislation, the informative and guidance components are not called up into legislation and they do not cover State and Territory variations and additions. Because informative and guidance components of the NCC do not have regulatory force, the ABCB accepts no responsibility for its contents when applied to specific buildings or any liability which may result from its use.</p><p>Defined words provide the precise meaning and expressions of key words used for understanding and complying with the NCC. Where a word is not defined in the NCC, the relevant common meaning of the word should be used.</p><p>Generally, a reference to a building is a reference to the whole building, regardless of classification. However, when a provision is applicable to a specific class or classes of building, that reference to a building may be a reference to the whole building or part of the building depending on how the building is classified.</p><p>Classes 1a and 1b, 7a and 7b, 9a, 9b and 9c, and 10a, 10b and 10c are separate classifications. In the NCC, when the designation 'a', 'b' or 'c' is not applied, the reference is to all buildings of the general class. For example, 'Class 9b' refers only to Class 9b buildings, but 'Class 9' refers to Classes 9a, 9b and 9c.</p><p>Whether a provision applies or not depends on the circumstances of the case and the circumstances in which the reference is made. For example, where a building has a single classification, a reference to a building in the NCC is understandably a reference to a whole building. However, where a building has parts of different classification, unless the contrary intention appears (i.e. there is a specific reference to the whole building), a reference to a building in the NCC is a reference to the relevant part of the building. This means that each part of the building must comply with the relevant provisions for its classification.</p><p>A number of the <xref format="dita" href="glossary-performance-requirement.xml#_f7304862-3529-49d7-9f62-352bcbcb6294" id="_9bd1d193-658d-4530-8e84-548b2edd6aae" referencetype="Text" scope="local" synctargettext="false" type="abcb-glossentry">Performance Requirements</xref> of the NCC use the expression “to the degree necessary” or “appropriate to”.
